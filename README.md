  ## Description
  A console application for basic math functions written in C#. This is the beginning of my foray into C sharp. I was fortunate enought to have the opportunity to work on a project but to be of use I will need to know the language well.
  I have some familiarity with Java and overcourse quite a bit in javaScript, but if there's one truth about software development it's the need to always be learning and expanding the tools you can work with. I'm really excited that I'm learning 
  and I'm working towards a goal with a solid foundation. It's been quite the journey learning the industry. There has been a few times I was ready to give up, and every time I pushed a little more and it's been worth it. Over the 
  next few weeks I'll be adding several small projects in C# as I keep working hard and expanding my knowlege.
